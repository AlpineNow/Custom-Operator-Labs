The *Bisecting K-Means* operator is a Spark Clustering Modeling Operator which identifies naturally-occurring groups of related members of a population based on their attributes.
It is a kind of divisive hierarchical clustering, which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters in a top-down approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as
one moves down to the hierarchy.
