The _Monte Carlo Simulation_ operator generates simulated scenarios from distributions fitted to numeric input data. Monte Carlo simulation is a technique widely used in financial markets, physical sciences, engineering and biomedical research.

The operator works by enabling users to specify explicit distributions to be fit to input columns. Distribution choices are Gaussian (Normal), Poisson, and Log-Normal. The user will also have to specify the number of samples to draw. Once executed, the operator generates sample scenarios and reports on the parameters of the distributions fitted to the input columns.
