# Custom-Operator-Previews
A repository for beta versions of upcoming Alpine operators, along with example Alpine workflows and dataset. As they haven't yet been thoroughly QA tested, please use them at your own risk.

To use these operators they must first be installed onto your Alpine server. Please see the Alpine documentation for help with this step. You can find [instructions here](https://alpine.atlassian.net/wiki/display/V6/How+To+Compile+and+Run+the+Sample+Operators) under the heading *Uploading an Operator to Alpine.*

These operators are developed internally using the [Alpine Plugin SDK](https://github.com/AlpineNow/PluginSDK) which you can use to develop your own custom operators.
